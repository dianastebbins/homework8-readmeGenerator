### Installation
```
npm inquirer and axios will need to be installed before running this application. To initiate the process, enter "node index.js" from a node.js terminal.
```

### Usage
```
Have github username and project repository name ready, as well as the url of the deployed application if that applies. Simply answer the question prompts in the terminal and when complete, the application will generate a README_<repository>.md file for you to use. You can copy/paste/move the file where you need. Note that you may want to remove the _<repository> from the file name when copying to the final location.
